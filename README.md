# Cre8iv Click's FormBuilder

Forms are often a pain to implement. Unfortunately, many sites need them, so we at [Cre8iv Click](https://cre8iv.click) decided to try and create a Kirby plugin to make dealing with forms easier. The FormBuilder plugin tries to help by doing 3 things:

### 1. Easy, Customised Form Creation in The Panel
The plugin provides a pre-made interface that allows the end-user to create and configure their custom form directly in the Panel. This allows the creation of many different types of forms - from standard 'Contact Us', through to long questionnaires.

### 2. Auto-creation of Form HTML in Templates
FormBuilder can generate the form's HTML code automatically, injecting it into your template or snippet with a single line of code.

### 3. Built-in Form Processing
A big part of handling forms is processing the submitted responses. FormBuilder provides ready-made functions to submit responses via email, and to display received responses in the Kirby Panel, too.

## Requirements, Installation & User Guide
FormBuilder requires the **[Kirby Builder Plugin](https://github.com/TimOetting/kirby-builder)** for its panel interface - make sure you install it, before installing FormBuilder.

For instructions on how to install FormBuilder, and how to use it in your Kirby site, please refer to the **[Wiki](https://gitlab.com/cre8ivclick/formbuilder/wikis/home)**.
